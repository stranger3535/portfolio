        <div class="about-text">
            <p>
                My name is <strong>Abhijith</strong>. I am a passionate and self-motivated web developer who loves
                learning new technologies and building clean, simple and responsive websites. I enjoy taking ideas
                and turning them into real interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>

            <p>
                I started my web development journey with the goal of understanding how websites work from the
                inside. Over time, I developed skills in frontend development, UI design, and creating user-friendly
                web experiences. I constantly work on improving my knowledge by practicing through projects,
                tutorials, and online resources.
            </p>

            <p>
                Apart from coding, I enjoy exploring new tools, solving problems, and experimenting with creative
                layouts. I believe that continuous learning is the key to becoming a great developer, and I work on
                building something new every day.
            </p>
